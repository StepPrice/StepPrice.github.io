                </p>
                <p>
                    The company made headlines in 2016 after its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo" title="AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a> program beat a human professional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" title="Go (game)">Go</a> player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol" title="Lee Sedol">Lee Sedol</a>, the world champion, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol" title="AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol">a five-game match</a>, which was the subject of a documentary film.

                <h2>What deepmind has been capable of</h2>
                <p>From Wikipeia</p>
                <h3>Machine learning</h3> <img src="hal.png" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <p>
                    DeepMind Technologies' goal is to "solve intelligence", which they are trying to achieve by combining "the best techniques from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine learning">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_neuroscience" title="Systems neuroscience">systems neuroscience</a> to build powerful general-purpose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_algorithms" class="mw-redirect" title="Learning algorithms">learning algorithms</a>".
                    They are trying to formalize intelligence in order to not only implement it into machines, but also understand the human brain, as Demis Hassabis explains:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Research has released a paper in 2016 regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety" class="mw-redirect" title="AI safety">AI Safety</a> and avoiding undesirable behaviour during the AI learning process. Deepmind has also released several publications via its website. In 2017 DeepMind released GridWorld, an open-source testbed for evaluating whether an algorithm learns to disable its <a href="/wiki/AI_control_problem#Kill_switch" title="AI control problem">kill switch</a> or otherwise exhibits certain undesirable behaviours.

                    To date, the company has published research on computer systems that are able to play games, and developing these systems, ranging from strategy games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" title="Go (game)">Go</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_games" class="mw-redirect" title="Arcade games">arcade games</a>. According to Shane Legg, human-level machine intelligence can be achieved "when a machine can learn to play a really wide range of games from perceptual stream input and output, and transfer understanding across games[...]."

                <h3>Deep reinforcement learning</h3>
                <p>
                    As opposed to other AIs, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)" title="Deep Blue (chess computer)">Deep Blue</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)" title="Watson (computer)">Watson</a>, which were developed for a pre-defined purpose and only function within its scope, DeepMind claims that its system is not pre-programmed: it learns from experience, using only raw pixels as data input. Technically it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" title="Deep learning">deep learning</a> on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" title="Convolutional neural network">convolutional neural network</a>, with a novel form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning" title="Q-learning">Q-learning</a>, a form of model-free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" title="Reinforcement learning">reinforcement learning</a>.  They test the system on video games, notably early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Games#Golden_Age" class="mw-redirect" title="Arcade Games">arcade games</a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)" title="Breakout (video game)">Breakout</a></i>. Without altering the code, the AI begins to understand how to play the game, and after some time plays, for a few games (most notably Breakout), a more efficient game than any human ever could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2013, DeepMind demonstrated an AI system could surpass human abilities in games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" title="Pong">Pong</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)" title="Breakout (video game)">Breakout</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaquest_(video_game)" title="Seaquest (video game)">Seaquest</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamrider" title="Beamrider">Beamrider</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enduro_(video_game)" title="Enduro (video game)">Enduro</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q*bert" title="Q*bert">Q*bert</a>. DeepMind's AI had been applied to video games made in the 1970s and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games#1980s" title="History of video games">1980s</a>; work was ongoing for more complex 3D games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(series)" class="mw-redirect" title="Doom (series)">Doom</a>, which first appeared in the early 1990s.
                </p>
                <h3>AlphaGo</h3> <img src="go.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <p>
                    In October 2015, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Go" title="Computer Go">computer Go</a> program called AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the European <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" title="Go (game)">Go</a> champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Hui" title="Fan Hui">Fan Hui</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings" title="Go ranks and ratings">2 dan</a> (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five to zero. This is the first time an artificial intelligence (AI) defeated a professional Go player. Previously, computers were only known to have played Go at "amateur" level. Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win compared to other games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a>, due to the much larger number of possibilities, making it prohibitively difficult for traditional AI methods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search" title="Brute-force search">brute-force</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In March 2016 it beat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol" title="Lee Sedol">Lee Sedol</a>—a 9th dan Go player and one of the highest ranked players in the world—with a score of 4-1 in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol" title="AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol">five-game match</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Go_Summit" title="Future of Go Summit">Future of Go Summit</a>, AlphaGo won a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Ke_Jie" title="AlphaGo versus Ke Jie">three-game match with Ke Jie</a>, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years. It used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" title="Supervised learning">supervised learning</a> protocol, studying large numbers of games played by humans against each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2017, an improved version, AlphaGo Zero, defeated AlphaGo 100 games to 0. AlphaGo Zero's strategies were self-taught. AlphaGo Zero was able to beat its predecessor after just three days with less processing power than AlphaGo; in comparison, the original AlphaGo needed months to learn how to play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later that year, AlphaZero, a modified version of AlphaGo Zero, gained superhuman abilities at chess and shogi. Like AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero learned solely through self-play.
