                    Thought-capable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_being" class="mw-redirect" title="Artificial being">artificial beings</a> appeared as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_device" class="mw-redirect" title="Storytelling device">storytelling devices</a> in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley" title="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek" title="Karel Čapek">Karel Čapek</a>'s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R._(Rossum%27s_Universal_Robots)" class="mw-redirect" title="R.U.R.

                    The study of mechanical or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_reasoning" class="mw-redirect" title="Formal reasoning">"formal" reasoning</a> began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher" title="Philosopher">philosophers</a> and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation" title="Theory of computation">theory of computation</a>, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis" title="Church–Turing thesis">Church–Turing thesis</a>. Along with concurrent discoveries in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience" title="Neuroscience">neurobiology</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" title="Information theory">information theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic" class="mw-redirect" title="Cybernetic">cybernetics</a>, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed that "if a human could not distinguish between responses from a machine and a human, the machine could be considered "intelligent". The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_McCullouch" class="mw-redirect" title="Warren McCullouch">McCullouch</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts" title="Walter Pitts">Pitts</a>' 1943 formal design for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete" class="mw-redirect" title="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a> "artificial neurons".

                <p>
                    The field of AI research was born at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop" title="Dartmouth workshop">a workshop</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> in 1956. Attendees <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell" title="Allen Newell">Allen Newell</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">CMU</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon" title="Herbert A. Simon">Herbert Simon</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">CMU</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" title="John McCarthy (computer scientist)">John McCarthy</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky" title="Marvin Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel" title="Arthur Samuel">Arthur Samuel</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>) became the founders and leaders of AI research. They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing": computers were learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts" title="Draughts">checkers</a> strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human), solving word problems in algebra, proving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem" title="Theorem">logical theorems</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist" title="Logic Theorist">Logic Theorist</a>, first run c. 1956) and speaking English. By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">Department of Defense</a> and laboratories had been established around the world. AI's founders were optimistic about the future: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon" title="Herbert A. Simon">Herbert Simon</a> predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky" title="Marvin Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> agreed, writing, "within a generation&nbsp;... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".

                <p>
                    They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_James_Lighthill" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir James Lighthill">Sir James Lighthill</a> and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter" title="AI winter">AI winter</a>", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.

                <p>
                    In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system" title="Expert system">expert systems</a>, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer" title="Fifth generation computer">fifth generation computer</a> project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_research" class="mw-redirect" title="Academic research">academic research</a>. However, beginning with the collapse of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machine" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisp Machine">Lisp Machine</a> market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.

                    In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining" title="Data mining">data mining</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis" title="Medical diagnosis">medical diagnosis</a> and other areas. The success was due to increasing computational power (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" title="Moore's law">Moore's law</a>), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization" title="Mathematical optimization">mathematics</a>), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Deep_Blue" class="mw-redirect" title="IBM Deep Blue">Deep Blue</a> became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, on 11 May 1997.

                    According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News" title="Bloomberg News">Bloomberg's</a> Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 2011. He attributes this to an increase in affordable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" title="Artificial neural network">neural networks</a>, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets. Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had "incorporated AI in some offerings or processes". Around 2016, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> greatly accelerated its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an "AI superpower".

                <h2>History of AI in business</h2>

                <p>
                    The 1980s is really when AI started to become prominent in the finance world. This is when Expert Systems became more of a commercial product in the financial field. “For example, Dupont had built 100 expert systems which helped them save close to $10 million a year.” One of the first systems was the Protrader expert system designed by K.C. Chen and Ting-peng Lian that was able to predict the 87-point drop in DOW Jones Industrial Average in 1986. “The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism.” One of the first expert systems that helped with financial plans was created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX) called the PlanPower. It was first commercially shipped in 1986. Its function was to help give financial plans for people with incomes over $75,000 a year. That then led to the Client Profiling System that was used for incomes between $25,000 and $200,000 a year. The 1990s was a lot more about fraud detection. One of the systems that was started in 1993 was the FinCEN Artificial Intelligence system (FAIS). It was able to review over 200,000 transactions per week and over two years it helped identify 400 potential cases of money laundering which would have been equal to $1 billion. Although Expert Systems didn't last in the finance world, it did help jump-start the use of AI and help make it what it is today.
