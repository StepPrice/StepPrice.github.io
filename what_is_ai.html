                <h2>Basic Questions about AI</h2>
                <p>By John McCarthy</p>
                <h3>Q. What is artificial intelligence? </h3>
                <p>
                    A. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of
                    using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to
                    confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.
                </p>
                <h3>Q. Yes, but what is intelligence?</h3>
                <p>
                    A. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in
                    the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many
                    animals and some machines.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Q. Isn’t there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn’t depend on
                    relating it to human intelligence?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general
                    what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We
                    understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others.
                </p>
                <img src="anatomy-1751201_1280.png" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <h3>
                    Q. Is intelligence a single thing so that one can ask a yes or no question
                    “Is this machine intelligent or not?”?

                </h3>
                <p>
                    A. No. Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered
                    how to make computers carry out some of them and not others. If doing a
                    task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, computer programs can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such programs
                    should be considered “somewhat intelligent”.
                </p>
                <h3>Q. Isn’t AI about simulating human intelligence?</h3>
                <p>
                    A. Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can
                    learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing
                    other people or just by observing our own methods. <br /><br /> On the other hand, most
                    work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence
                    rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing
                    than people can do.

                <img src="defining.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />

                <h2>Why is AI hard to define</h2>
                <p>From The University of Helsinki</p>
                <h3>Whe can't agree on the definition</h3>
                <p>
                    Even AI researchers have no exact definition of AI. The field is rather being constantly redefined when some topics are classified as non-AI, and new topics emerge. <br /><br />

                    There´s an old (geeky) joke that AI is defined as “cool things that computers can't do.” The irony is that under this definition, AI can never make any progress: as soon as we find a way to do something cool with a computer, it stops being an AI problem. However, there is an element of truth in this definition. Fifty years ago, for instance, automatic methods for search and planning were considered to belong to the domain of AI. Nowadays such methods are taught to every computer science student. Similarly, certain methods for processing uncertain information are becoming so well understood that they are likely to be moved from AI to statistics or probability very soon.
                </p>
                <h3>Cinematic presence</h3>
                <img src="scifi.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />

                <p>
                    The confusion about the meaning of AI is made worse by the visions of AI present in various literary and cinematic works of science fiction. Science fiction stories often feature friendly humanoid servants that provide overly-detailed factoids or witty dialogue, but can sometimes follow the steps of Pinocchio and start to wonder if they can become human. Another class of humanoid beings in sci-fi espouse sinister motives and turn against their masters in the vein of old tales of sorcerers' apprentices, going back to the Golem of Prague and beyond. <br /><br />

                    Often the robothood of such creatures is only a thin veneer on top of a very humanlike agent, which is understandable as most fiction – even science fiction – needs to be relatable by human readers who would otherwise be alienated by intelligence that is too different and strange. Most science fiction is thus best read as metaphor for the current human condition, and robots could be seen as stand-ins for repressed sections of society, or perhaps our search for the meaning of life.
                </p>
                <h3>what seems easy is actually hard…</h3>
                <img src="robot.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <p>
                    Another source of difficulty in understanding AI is that it is hard to know which tasks are easy and which ones are hard. Look around and pick up an object in your hand, then think about what you did: you used your eyes to scan your surroundings, figured out where are some suitable objects for picking up, chose one of them and planned a trajectory for your hand to reach that one, then moved your hand by contracting various muscles in sequence and managed to squeeze the object with just the right amount of force to keep it between your fingers. <br /><br />

                    It can be hard to appreciate how complicated all this is, but sometimes it becomes visible when something goes wrong: the object you pick is much heavier or lighter than you expected, or someone else opens a door just as you are reaching for the handle, and then you can find yourself seriously out of balance. Usually these kinds of tasks feel effortless, but that feeling belies millions of years of evolution and several years of childhood practice. <br /><br />

                    While easy for you, grasping objects by a robot is extremely hard, and it is an area of active study.
