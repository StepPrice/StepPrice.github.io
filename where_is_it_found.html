                <h3></h3>
                <p>
                    In agriculture new AI advancements show improvements in gaining yield and to increase the research and development of growing crops.<br /> New artificial intelligence now predicts the time it takes for a crop like a tomato to be ripe and ready for picking thus increasing efficiency of farming.<br />
                    These advances go on including Crop and Soil Monitoring,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_robot" title="Agricultural robot">Agricultural Robots</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics" title="Predictive analytics">Predictive Analytics</a>.
                    Crop and soil monitoring uses new algorithms and data collected on the field to manage and track the health of crops making it easier and more sustainable for the farmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More specializations of Ai in agriculture is one such as greenhouse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation" title="Automation">automation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation" title="Simulation">simulation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_and_simulation" title="Modeling and simulation">modeling</a>, and optimization techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the increase in population and the growth of demand for food in the future there will need to be at least a 70% increase in yield from agriculture to sustain this new demand. More and more of the public perceives that the adaption of these new techniques and the use of Artificial intelligence will help reach that goal.

                <h3>Computer science</h3>
                <p>
                    AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered a part of AI. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect" title="AI effect">AI effect</a>.) According to <a href="#CITEREFRussellNorvig2003">Russell &amp; Norvig (2003</a>, p.&nbsp;15), all of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories:

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading" title="Algorithmic trading">Algorithmic trading</a> involves the use of complex AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds several orders of magnitudes greater than any human is capable of, often making millions of trades in a day without any human intervention. Such trading is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_Trading" class="mw-redirect" title="High-frequency Trading">High-frequency Trading</a>, and it represents one of the fastest growing sectors in financial trading. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios which are managed purely by AI systems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_trading_system" title="Automated trading system">Automated trading systems</a> are typically used by large institutional investors, but recent years have also seen an influx of smaller, proprietary firms trading with their own AI systems.

                <h3>
                    Personal finance
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Several products are emerging that utilize AI to assist people with their personal finances. For example, Digit is an app powered by artificial intelligence that automatically helps consumers optimize their spending and savings based on their own personal habits and goals. The app can analyze factors such as monthly income, current balance, and spending habits, then make its own decisions and transfer money to the savings account. Wallet.AI, an upcoming startup in San Francisco, builds agents that analyze data that a consumer would leave behind, from Smartphone check-ins to tweets, to inform the consumer about their spending behavior.
                </p>
                <h3>Human resources and recruiting</h3><img src="writing.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <p>
                    Another application of AI is in the human resources and recruiting space. There are three ways AI is being used by human resources and recruiting professionals: to screen resumes and rank candidates according to their level of qualification, to predict candidate success in given roles through job matching platforms, and now rolling out recruiting chat bots that can automate repetitive communication tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, resume screening involves a recruiter or other HR professional scanning through a database of resumes. Now startups like Pomato are creating machine learning algorithms to automate resume screening processes. Pomato’s resume screening AI focuses on automating validating technical applicants for technical staffing firms. Pomato’s AI performs over 200,000 computations on each resume in seconds then designs a custom technical interview based on the mined skills. KE Solutions, founded in 2014, has developed recommendation systems to rank jobs for candidates, and rank resumes for employers. jobster.io, developed by KE Solutions, uses concept-based search that has increased accuracy by 80% compared to traditional ATS. It helps recruiters to overcome technical barriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 2016 to 2017, consumer goods company Unilever used artificial intelligence to screen all entry-level employees. Unilever’s AI used neuroscience-based games, recorded interviews, and facial and speech analysis to predict hiring success. Unilever partnered with Pymetrics and HireVue to enable its AI-based screening and increased their applicants from 15,000 to 30,000 in a single year. Recruiting with AI produced Unililever’s “most diverse class to date’. Unilever also decreased time to hire from 4 months to four weeks and saved over 50,000 hours of recruiter time.

                <h3>News, publishing and writing</h3>
                <img src="newspaper.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <p>
                    The company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_Science" title="Narrative Science">Narrative Science</a> makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_generated_journalism" class="mw-redirect" title="Computer generated journalism">computer-generated news</a> and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game in English. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses. Similarly, the company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Insights" title="Automated Insights">Automated Insights</a> generates personalized recaps and previews for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports" title="Yahoo Sports">Yahoo Sports</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(American)" title="Fantasy football (American)">Fantasy Football</a>. The company is projected to generate one billion stories in 2014, up from 350 million in 2013.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Echobox is a software company that helps publishers increase traffic by 'intelligently' posting articles on social media platforms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>. By analysing large amounts of data, it learns how specific audiences respond to different articles at different times of the day. It then chooses the best stories to post and the best times to post them. It uses both historical and real-time data to understand to what has worked well in the past as well as what is currently trending on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another company, called Yseop, uses artificial intelligence to turn structured data into intelligent comments and recommendations in natural language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yseop" title="Yseop">Yseop</a> is able to write financial reports, executive summaries, personalized sales or marketing documents and more at a speed of thousands of pages per second and in multiple languages including English, Spanish, French &amp; German.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boomtrain’s is another example of AI that is designed to learn how to best engage each individual reader with the exact articles — sent through the right channel at the right time — that will be most relevant to the reader. It's like hiring a personal editor for each individual reader to curate the perfect reading experience.

                <p>
                    Beyond automation of writing tasks given data input, AI has shown significant potential for computers to engage in higher-level creative work. AI Storytelling has been an active field of research since James Meehan's development of TALESPIN, which made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop. The program would start with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals, with the story as a narration of the characters’ attempts at executing plans to satisfy these goals.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Since Meehan, other researchers have worked on AI Storytelling using similar or different approaches. Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko argued that the essence of storytelling was an experience management problem, or "how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which are often at odds."
