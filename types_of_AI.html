                <h2>What Branches of AI exist</h2>
                <p>by John McCarthy</p>

                <h3>logical AI</h3>
                <p>
                    What a program knows about the world in general the facts
                    of the specific situation in which it must act, and its goals are all
                    represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language. The
                    program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are appropriate for achieving its goals.
                </p>
                <h3>search</h3>
                <p>
                    AI programs often examine large numbers of possibilities, e.g. moves
                    in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program. Discoveries are continually made about how to do this more efficiently in various
                    domains.
                </p>
                <h3>pattern recognition</h3>
                <p>
                    When a program makes observations of some kind,
                    it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern. For
                    example, a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a
                    nose in a scene in order to find a face. More complex patterns, e.g. in
                    a natural language text, in a chess position, or in the history of some
                    event are also studied. These more complex patterns require quite
                    different methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied
                    the most.
                </p>
                <h3>representation</h3><img src=" artificial-intelligence-2228610_1280.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <p>
                    Facts about the world have to be represented in some way.
                    Usually languages of mathematical logic are used.
                </p>
                <h3>inference</h3>
                <p>
                    From some facts, others can be inferred. Mathematical logical
                    deduction is adequate for some purposes, but new methods of nonmonotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s. The
                    simplest kind of non-monotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which
                    a conclusion is to be inferred by default, but the conclusion can be
                    withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary. For example, when
                    we hear of a bird, we man infer that it can fly, but this conclusion
                    can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin. It is the possibility that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the
                    non-monotonic character of the reasoning. Ordinary logical reasoning
                    is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from
                    a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises.
                    Circumscription is another form of non-monotonic reasoning
                </p>
                <h3>common sense knowledge and reasoning</h3><img src="network.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />
                <p>
                    This is the area in which AI
                    is farthest from human-level, in spite of the fact that it has been an
                    active research area since the 1950s. While there has been considerable
                    progress, e.g. in developing systems of non-monotonic reasoning and
                    theories of action, yet more new ideas are needed. The Cyc system
                    contains a large but spotty collection of common sense facts.
                </p>
                <h3>learning from experience </h3>
                <p>
                    Programs do that. The approaches to AI based
                    on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that. There is also learning of laws expressed in logic
                    <br /><br />
                    Programs can only learn what facts
                    or behaviors their formalisms can represent, and unfortunately learning systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent
                    information.

                </p>
                <h3>heuristics</h3>
                <p>
                    A heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea
                    imbedded in a program. The term is used variously in AI. Heuristic
                    functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far
                    a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal. Heuristic predicates
                    that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the
                    other, i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal, may be more useful.
